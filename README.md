# 🎮 Outrun the Void

**Outrun the Void** is an infinite 3D runner game developed in **Unity**, focused on fast-paced movement, increasing challenge, and modular gameplay systems.  
The player controls a cube that must run, jump, and react to dynamically evolving obstacles while avoiding falling into the void.

This project is being developed as a **personal portfolio project** with an emphasis on clean architecture, scalability, and real-time gameplay mechanics.

---

## Core Gameplay
- Infinite 3D runner with progressively increasing difficulty  
- Player-controlled cube with:
  - Left / Right movement  
  - Jump and double jump mechanics  
- The game continues indefinitely until the player fails

---

## Environment & Visual Systems
- Uses **FARLAND Skies** skybox  
- Custom day–night cycle system:
  - Smooth transitions between **sunrise, day, sunset, and night**
  - Dynamic movement of the **sun, moon, and clouds**
  - Runtime sky color modulation via script

---

## Gameplay Systems & Mechanics
- **Adaptive difficulty system**:
  - Obstacles become faster over time
  - Obstacle shapes increase in complexity
  - New obstacle types are introduced progressively
- **Dynamic platforms**:
  - Platform position changes over time (up/down/left/right)
  - Forces constant player adaptation and spatial awareness
- Camera system that smoothly follows the player to maintain readability and flow

---

## Technical Focus
- Modular and scalable gameplay systems  
- Clear separation between player control, environment logic, and difficulty progression  
- Real-time mechanics designed for extensibility and iteration  
- Written entirely in **C#**, following Unity best practices

---

## Technologies
- **Engine:** Unity  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Tools:** Unity Editor, Git  
- **Platform:** PC (development)

---

## Project Status
🔧 **In progress**  
The project is actively being developed, with ongoing improvements to gameplay depth, polish, and visual feedback.
